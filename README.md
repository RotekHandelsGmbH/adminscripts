# Admin Scripts

## Install
To clone the adminscripts_public repo (master branch) to your local machine, open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RotekHandelsGmbH/adminscripts_public.git
```

This will create a folder called adminscripts_public with everything from the master branch. If you only want the latest snapshot (a “shallow” clone), you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/RotekHandelsGmbH/adminscripts_public.git
```
